# DG-LGL-solver-for-one-dimensional-shallow-water-equation
Discontinuous Galerkin finite element method, first introduced by Reed and Hill has
been incorporated in this work to solve linearised one-dimensional shallow water system. In
which the interpolation points are Gauss-Lobatto points and integration follows Gauss Legendre
polynomials. For time discretization Runge-Kutta method is utilized.
